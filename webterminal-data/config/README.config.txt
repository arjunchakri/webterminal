To use a custom JDK,
- Create a file - javahome.json
- Configure the java home in the file, in one line.
- Make sure to the jdk path before "bin" directory (similar to how you would set JAVA_HOME system property).
- Use this option if you dont have jdk set in system path (eg, if javac command doesnt work)
